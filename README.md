# 7-Segment-Display-Counter
This is a sample project of how to make a counter using a single (common cathode) 7 segment display. The development environment is Arduino IDE, the used board was ELEGOO Uno R3, and the schematic was done with Tinkercad. Notice that you can play with the value for electrical resistance to calibrate the display's brightness. It is recommended to use a 220Ω or 1kΩ resistor.
